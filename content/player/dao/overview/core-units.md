## Grant Support Squad:

The Grant Support Squad in Decentraland is a core unit created in June 2022 to provide support to the community members who receive grants, foster transparency in the grants ecosystem and take care of the DAO treasury, with the main objective of guaranteeing successful projects from the grants program. 

The team is integrated by 3 members:

* Juan Cassinelli Our accountability manager, responsible for concerns about the grantees raised by the community and revocations of grants when it is needed.
* Pablo Lewin Our partnerships manager, responsible for creating long-term relationships with the grants program stakeholders such as Decentraland Foundation.
* Gia Castello Our advisor of the team, who provides tools and methodologies to listen to the community, measure impact and suggest changes based on the community needs.  

The squad is in constant dialogue with the grantees community, to understand their needs and provide support to their blockers and requests.

The Grant Support Squad is funded by the DAO treasury via its grants program, and renewed every 6 months via a grant request voted by the DAO community.

## Governance Squad

The Governance Squad was formed in January 2022 as the first DAO operational team funded using the Grants Program for the community. Its goal is to develop, enhance and maintain the technological infrastructure used by the DAO members to make decisions about the Decentraland project. 

The team structure was designed as an autonomous agile development team. Currently is formed by 5 members:

* @ginoct - Product Lead - Responsible for developing the blueprints of the development projects, interface with the community and define the priorities for the team to work on.

* @daleguane - Product Designer - Responsible for understanding our userâ€™s needs and developing and polishing the UI/UX flows of the product that the team develop.

* @andyesp, @lemu, @byte - Developers - Crafting open source code that empowers the community to take better decisions by providing information and consensus mechanisms. 

The squad work in a transparent way, pushing all the code to this, this and this Github repository and providing updates during Town Hall meetings and via the Release Notes page.
