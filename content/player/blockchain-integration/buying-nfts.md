## Buying NFTs directly through Decentraland's Smart Contracts

Users can easily buy Land, Estates, Names, Wearables and Emotes using the [Marketplace](https://market.decentraland.org/). As easy as it seems to do it in the website, there are various Smart Contracts both on the Ethereum Network and the Polygon Network that make this possible.

Lands, Estates and Names are commercialized in the marketplace using a different contract than the ones used for Wearables and Emotes, and Wearables that you buy from the store listed as primary sales use a different one as well. Users are also able to place bids for different NFTs which are also handled by different contracts.

Hopefully this guide will let you understand the different Smart Contracts used behind the scenes to make the marketplace possible, and the ways one can interact with this contracts directly to execute a purchase without the need or relying on a UI.

## Smart Contracts

This is a list of smart contracts which are made accessible to users through the marketplace application.

**Mainnet**

- Marketplace [0x8e5660b4ab70168b5a6feea0e0315cb49c8cd539](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8e5660b4ab70168b5a6feea0e0315cb49c8cd539)

- Bids [0xe479dfd9664c693b2e2992300930b00bfde08233](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe479dfd9664c693b2e2992300930b00bfde08233)

**Polygon**

- Marketplace [0x480a0f4e360E8964e68858Dd231c2922f1df45Ef](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x480a0f4e360E8964e68858Dd231c2922f1df45Ef)

- Bids [0xb96697FA4A3361Ba35B774a42c58dACcaAd1B8E1](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb96697FA4A3361Ba35B774a42c58dACcaAd1B8E1)

- CollectionStore [0x214ffC0f0103735728dc66b61A22e4F163e275ae](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x214ffC0f0103735728dc66b61A22e4F163e275ae)

As you can see, there are contracts both in the Ethereum and the Polygon networks. This is because different kind of assets can be found in a network and the rest in the other. For example, LANDs, Estates and Names are all in the Ethereum Network while Wearables and Emotes are in the Polygon Network.

**Networks are not interoperable, meaning that you cannot buy Wearables in the Ethereum network or place bids for LANDs in Polygon. Contracts can only interact with the assets found in their same networks.**

## Marketplace

The Marketplace Smart Contract is the one that allows users to create an Order to sell their assets. On Ethereum, you can create an Order to sell LANDs, Estates and Names while on Polygon, the Marketplace Smart Contract allows the user to create Orders for Wearables and Emotes.

Orders can be created using the `createOrder` function that has the following signature.

```sol
/// @param nftAddress The address of the NFT contract (The LandRegistry, EstateRegistry or Wearable/Emote Collection address).
/// @param assetId The token id of the NFT.
/// @param priceInWei The price (in MANA) the sender wants the NFT to be sold for.
/// @param expiresAt The duration the order will last until it cannot be executed anymore.
function createOrder(
  address nftAddress,
  uint256 assetId,
  uint256 priceInWei,
  uint256 expiresAt
)
```

Once an Order has been created on-chain, any user that has the sufficient MANA, and as long as the Order is not expired, has the ability to execute the Order and purchase the NFT.

An order is executed by calling the `executeOrder` function in the Marketplace Smart Contract.

```sol
/// @param nftAddress The address of the NFT contract (The LandRegistry, EstateRegistry or Wearable/Emote Collection address).
/// @param assetId The token id of the NFT.
/// @param price The price (in MANA) the caller wants to purchase the NFT for.
///        Has to match the price of the Order for that NFT.
function executeOrder(
  address nftAddress,
  uint256 assetId,
  uint256 price
)
```

When the transaction to execute an Order is successful. The buyer will pay the price in MANA to the owner of the NFT, and the NFT will be transferred from the owner to the buyer, which becomes the new owner.

There is another way to execute Orders which is by calling 'safeExecuteOrder'.

```sol
/// @param nftAddress The address of the NFT contract (The LandRegistry, EstateRegistry or Wearable/Emote Collection address).
/// @param assetId The token id of the NFT.
/// @param price The price (in MANA) the caller wants to purchase the NFT for.
///        Has to match the price of the Order for that NFT.
/// @param fingerprint Data that determines how the NFT has to be composed of for the Order to be executed.
function safeExecuteOrder(
  address nftAddress,
  uint256 assetId,
  uint256 price,
  bytes memory fingerprint
)
```

Composable NFTs (NFTs made up of other NFTs such as Estates that are composed of many LANDs) have a fingerprint that determines what they are composed of.

By executing an Order providing a fingerprint, you are telling the contract that you want that NFT to be composed in a certain way, if it is different, the Order will fail to be executed.

This a safe mechanism to avoid bad actors from removing all LAND from an Estate before an interested buyer purchases it.

More information about it can be found in [Integrating Decentraland's Estate in your Marketplace](/player/blockchain-integration/estates-marketplace-integrations)

## Bids

Soon...

## CollectionStore

This smart contract can only be found on the Polygon Network. This is because Wearable and Emote Collections only exist on that chain, meaning that there is no purpose for it to be on Ethereum unless Collections were published there.

When a creator publishes a collection and it is approved by the curation committee. The creator can then put the collection on sale in the marketplace, allowing other users to be able to buy the items of that collection for the price determined by the creator.

When you are buying items from a collection this way, you are actually minting a new NFT that can then be commercialized with the Polygon Marketplace or Bids smart contract. 

If a collection is on sale, any user with the sufficient amount of MANA can buy an item from it as long as there is stock left to be minted.

The CollectionStore smart contract exposes the `buy` function to do so.

```sol
/// @param _itemsToBuy A list of items from different collections that the caller want to buy.
function buy(ItemToBuy[] memory _itemsToBuy)
```

```sol
struct ItemToBuy {
  // The address of the collection the items in the ids array belong to.
  IERC721CollectionV2 collection;
  // The id of the particular items in the collection that the caller want to buy.
  uint256[] ids;
  // The price that the buyer wants to pay for the item in the same index. 
  // Must be equal to the price set by the creator.
  uint256[] prices;
  // The addresses that will receive the minted items in the same index.
  address[] beneficiaries;
}
```

To make this easier to understand. Imagine that I want to buy item "Spooky Hat" with item id 0 from the collection called "Halloween Madness". 

The hat has been determined by the creator to have a price of 20 MANA.

To buy the item I would have to call the `buy` function with the following data:

```js
buy(
  [
    [
      "0xHalloweenMadnessAddress",
      ["0"], // The item id of the Spooky Hat, other items in the collection will have different incrementing ids.
      ["20000000000000000000"], // Which is the equivalent in wei to 20
      ["My own address"]
    ]
  ]
)
```

When the transaction to buy the item is successful. 20 MANA will be transferred from my address to the creator (or a beneficiary defined by the creator), the hat will be minted as an NFT and transferred to me.
