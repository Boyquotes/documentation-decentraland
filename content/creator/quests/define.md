To start getting knowledge of how to define a Quest, let's take a look at the Quest schema as a Typescript type:
```typescript
{
    name: string,
    description: string,
    imageUrl: string,
    definition: {
        steps: {
            id: string,
            description: string,
            tasks: {
                id: string,
                description: string,
                actionItems: {
                    type: string,
                    parameters: {[key: string]: string]}
                }[]
            }[]
        }[],
        connections: {
            stepFrom: string,
            stepTo: string
        }[]
    },
    reward: { 
        hook: { 
            webhookUrl: string, 
            requestBody: { [key: string]: string } |Â null 
        },
        items: {
            name: string, 
            imageLink: string
        }[]
    } | null,
}
```

Let's start with the basics field:

- `name`: This is simple as its field's name. It's just the name of the Quest and the name that will be used on Decentraland to display it.
- `description`: A short description of the Quest to give the user an idea of what the Quest is about.
- `imageUrl`: The URL of the image that will be used to display the Quest on Decentraland.

Now, let's take a look at the `definition` field. This field is the most important one as it defines the steps and the order of the Quest.

- `steps`: This is an array of steps. Each step has an `id`, a `description` and an array of `tasks`. 
    - `id`: must be a unique identifier of the step. 
    - `description`: a short description of the step.
    - `tasks`: This is an array of tasks that the user has to complete to consider the step as done. Each task has an `id`, a `description` and an array of `actionItems`. 
        - `id` must be a unique identifier of the task. 
        - `description` is a short description of the task.
        - `actionItems`: This is an array of action items that the user has to complete to consider the task as done. Each action item has a `type` and a `parameters` field. 
            - `type`: This is the type of the action item. We currently support a set of `type`s. You can find the supported types [here](#action-items).
            - `parameters`: This is an object with the parameters needed to complete the action item. The parameters are different depending on the type of the action item. We currently support a set of `parameters` for each type. You can find the supported parameters [here](#action-items).
- `connections`: This is an array of connections. Each connection has a `stepFrom` and a `stepTo` field. The connections define the order of the steps. The steps that don't have a "from" defined within this array will be considered as the starting steps of the Quest. The steps that don't have a "to" defined within this array will be considered as the ending steps of the Quest. It's worth to mention that one step can take the users to more than one step.
    - `stepFrom`: it is the `id` of the step where the connection starts. 
    - `stepTo`: it is the `id` of the step where the connection ends.

The relation between steps, tasks, and action items is the following: A Quest has steps, each step could have multiple tasks, and each task could have multiple action items. The task is considered as "done", when the Quest Player has completed all the action items within the task. The step is considered as "done", when the Quest Player has completed all the tasks within the step.

An action is the smallest unit of work that the Quest Player has to complete. It's worth to mention that if you as a Quest Creator wants the Quest Player to repeat an action more than one time, you can just add the same action item more than one time within the `actionItems` array.

Finally, let's take a look at the `reward` field. This field defines the reward that the user will receive when the Quest is completed. It's not mandatory for a Quest to give a reward to the user.

- `hook`: This is an object with two fields: `webhookUrl` and `requestBody`. 
    - `webhookUrl`: it is the URL of the webhook that will be called when the Quest is completed. 
    - `requestBody`: it is an object with the parameters that will be sent to the webhook. The webhook will be called with a POST request with the `requestBody` as the body of the request. The `requestBody` is optional.
- `items`: This is an array of items. The items are the rewards that the Quest will give to each user when they complete the Quest. Each item has a `name` and an `imageLink` field. 
    - `name`: is the name of the item. 
    - `imageLink`: is the URL of the image that will be used to display the item on Decentraland.

You can find more information about the Quest's reward [here](/creator/quests/rewards).

## Action Items

The action items are the tasks that the user has to complete to consider a task as done. We currently support a set of `type`s and `parameters` for each type.

- **Location**: This action item is used to check if the user is at a specific coordinates. This action can be detected by the Quest Client library's system helpers. The `parameters` are the coordinates of the location. The `parameters` are:
    - `x`: The x coordinate of the location.
    - `y`: The y coordinate of the location.
```typescript
    {
        type: "LOCATION",
        parameters: { "x": string, "y": string }
    }
```

- **Jump**: This action item is used to check if the user has jumped. This action can be detected by the Quest Client library's system helpers. The `parameters` are the coordinates of the location where the user has to jump. The `parameters` are:
    - `x`: The x coordinate of the location.
    - `y`: The y coordinate of the location.
```typescript
    {
        type: "JUMP",
        parameters: { "x": string, "y": string }
    }
```

- **Emote**: This action item is used to check if the user has played an emote. This action can be detected by the Quest Client library's system helpers. The `parameters` are the coordinates of the location where the user has to play the emote and the `emote_id` of the emote that the user has to play. The `parameters` are:
    - `x`: The x coordinate of the location.
    - `y`: The y coordinate of the location.
    - `emote_id`: The `emote_id` of the emote that the user has to play.
```typescript
    {
        type: "EMOTE",
        parameters: { "x": string, "y": string, "emote_id": string }
    }
```

- **Custom**: This action item is used to check if the user has completed a custom action. This action is a "third-party" action so the Quest Creator is responsible to send the event to the Quest Service when it ocurrs. There is only one field within `parameters`. The field is:
    - `id`: The `id` of the custom action that the user has to complete.
```typescript
    {
        type: "CUSTOM",
        parameters: { "id": string }
    }
```
An example of a `CUSTOM` action item could be a "click on a box", or "kill 10 zombies". The Quest Creator is responsible to send the event to the Quest Service when the user completes the action since he's the one that knows when the action is completed.
