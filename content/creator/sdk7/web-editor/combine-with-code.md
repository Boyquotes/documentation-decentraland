The Creator Hub plus custom code is a very powerful combination for creating content. You can use the Scene Editor to position items intuitively, and then write code that interacts with these items with complete freedom. You can even place a smart item, that has its own default behavior, and write code that reacts to when the item is activated.

For example, you can take advantage of an existing lever smart item, that already comes with its sounds and animations and states, and write code that detects when the lever is pulled to run your own custom logic.

## Export to desktop

To edit the code in a scene created with the [web editor]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/web-editor/web-editor.md" >}}), you must export the scene to your machine and open it with the Creator Hub.

**ðŸ“” Note**: If you don't have the Creator Hub installed, follow the steps in the following page before your start.

[Install Creator Hub]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/editor-installation.md" >}})
{{< /hint >}}

1. Click the **Download icon** on the top menu while editing the scene.

2. This will download a _.zip_ file, extract it.
3. Open the **Creator Hub**, go into the **Scene Editor** section.
4. Click the **Import** button and select the path to your exported project folder.

Once you're done, you can keep working on your project inside the Creator Hub, with an interface that looks just like the Web Editor.

You can also edit the files under the `/src` folder to add behavior with code to your scene.

See [Combine with code]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/smart-items/combine-with-code.md" >}}) for how to edit the code of your scene.
