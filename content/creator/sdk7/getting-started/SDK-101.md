The Decentraland SDK is a powerful tool that lets you create scenes by writing in Typescript (Javascript + Types).

This mini-tutorial walks you through how to get set up, and shows you the basic parts of a Decentraland scene.

## Install the Creator Hub

The Creator Hub allows you to build, preview and deploy Decentraland scenes.

To install the Creator Hub:

<!-- TODO -->

To edith your scene's code, you must also install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.

Read [Installation guide]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/editor-installation.md" >}}) for more details about installing the Creator Hub.

## Create your first scene

To create your first scene, follow these steps.

1. Open the Creator Hub.
2. Click the **Scenes** tab, and press **Create Scene** button
   <img src="/images/editor/create-scene.png" width="150" alt="Scene name"/>
3. You can then pick between different starting templates. For this exercise, pick **Empty Scene**.

This step may take a couple of minutes. It populates your folder with the default set of files for a basic scene.

Once that's done, you'll see the empty grid of your scene.

## Add items from the asset packs

Explore the **Asset packs** on the bottom section of the Scene Editor, drop any item you want, and adjust its positions.

<img src="/images/editor/asset-packs.png" alt="Scene name"/>

To place an item, click and drag it in from the asset pack menu into a location on your scene in the canvas.

<img src="/images/editor/drop-item.gif" width="300" alt="Scene name"/>

Click and drag a selected item to move it freely around the scene at ground level. See [Scene editor essentials]({{< ref "/content/creator/scene-editor/scene-editor-essentials.md#position-items" >}}) for more details.

{{< hint info >}}
**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Cover the entire scene with a ground item. Items of type **Ground** have a paint bucket icon on them. If you drag one of these into your scene, it covers all of your scene's ground with copies of this item.

<img src="/images/editor/ground.png" width="500" />
{{< /hint >}}

## Run a preview

Click the **Preview** button on the top menu to load your scene inside Decentraland. You can now explore the scene in first person.

TODO: screenshot

<!-- <img src="/images/editor/preview-button.png" width="150" alt="Scene name"/> -->

Read more about the scene preview in [preview a scene]({{< ref "/content/creator/scenes/getting-started/preview-scene.md" >}}).

## Custom 3D assets

Download this 3D model of an avocado in _glb_ format from the following [link](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/avocado/raw/main/avocado-glb.zip) and unzip it.

![](/images/media/avocado.jpg)

1. Click the plus sign on the top-right corner of the Asset Packs section of the Scene Editor UI.

2. Drag the **avocado.glb** file onto the region on the Scene Editor UI.
   <img src="/images/editor/import-avocado.png" width="500" />
3. You can now find the avocado model in the **Local Assets** tab, under the **Scene** folder.
   <img src="/images/editor/avocado-in-local-assets.png" width="500" />

You can now drag the **avocado.glb** file from the **Local Assets** onto your scene, like with any item from the Asset Packs.

## Edit the scene code

The next sections describe how you can edit your scene's code, giving you far more freedom in what you can do as a creator.

Click the **<> Code** button on the top menu to open your scene project on Visual Studio Code.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you don't have it already.
{{< /hint >}}

This opens a separate window with Visual Studio Code. On the left margin you can navigate the full file structure of your project.

<img src="/images/editor/files-on-vs-studio.png" alt="Scene name" width="200"/>

Open the `src/index.ts` file from your scene folder. It should look like this:

```ts
import {} from '@dcl/sdk/math'
import { engine } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export function main() {}
```

Notice that this file defines a function called `main`. This function is the entry point to the scene, any code you want the scene to run when it fist loads needs to either be inside this function or be indirectly called by this function.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: All the code we'll add from this point on will be inside the `main()` function.
{{< /hint >}}

In the previous section we already saw how you can easily add our custom avocado 3D model to your scene in a no-code way. Now we'll see how it looks to achieve the same by writing code.

In your sceneâ€™s `index.ts` file, expand the `main()` function by adding the following lines:

```ts
export function main() {
	// create avocado entity
	let avocado = engine.addEntity()

	// give the avocado a Transform
	Transform.create(avocado, {
		position: Vector3.create(3, 1, 3),
	})

	// give the avocado a GLTF
	GltfContainer.create(avocado, {
		src: 'assets/scene/avocado.glb',
	})
}
```

{{< hint info >}}
**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Visual Studio Code helps you by marking syntax errors, autocompleting while you write and even showing smart suggestions that depend on context. Also click on an object to see the full definition of its class.

If any of the words you pasted are underlined in red, hover over them to see if VS Studio offers an easy solution. In this case clicking the lightbulb will suggest `Update import from @dcl/sdk/ecs`. Select this option to import these components into your scene.

You'll likely have to do this for **Transform**, **GltfContainer**, and **Vector3**.
{{< /hint >}}

<!-- If you had the scene preview already running, close it. Then open the preview once again to see that the 3D model is now there too. -->

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

<!-- ![](/images/media/avocado.jpg) -->

The lines you just added create a new [entity]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/entities-components.md" >}}), give it a [shape]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/shape-components.md" >}}) based on the 3D model you downloaded, and [set its position and scale]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/entity-positioning.md" >}}).

<!-- Note that the cubes in your scene all rotate smoothly, but not the avocado you just added. That's because a [system]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/architecture/systems.md" >}}) named `circularSystem` that comes defined in this template in the `systems.ts` file is running. This system runs a function on every frame (30 times a second). This system in particular tells every entity that has both a `Spinner` and a `Transform` component in the scene to rotate just a tiny bit, once per frame. Your avocado model doesn't have a `Spinner` component, so it's not affected by this system. If you delete or comment out the code for the `circularSystem` system, all entities stop rotating.

To make your avocado spin like the cubes, you can simply give it a `Spinner` component.

```ts
import { Spinner } from './components'

export function main() {
	// initial code

	let avocado = engine.addEntity()

	GltfContainer.create(avocado, {
		src: 'models/avocado.glb',
	})

	Transform.create(avocado, {
		position: Vector3.create(3, 1, 3),
	})

	Spinner.create(avocado, { speed: 1 })
}
```

With this extra component, the avocado should now behave like the cubes and slowly spin too. Note that the `speed` property lets you make it rotate faster or slower.

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: The `Spinner` comopnent only exists in the context of this scene. If you try to add a `Spinner` component in another scene, it won't recognize it, unless you also copy the definition of the component, that you can find in the `components.ts` file.

The `Spinner` comopnent itself doesn't cause the spinning, it just marks an entity. To make entities spin in other scenes, you should also copy the `circularSystem` system, in the `systems.ts` file, that carries out the actual spinning behavior.
{{< /hint >}} -->

## Add interactivity

To make your scene more engaging, make the entities in the scene respond to the player's interactions.

Still inside the `main()` function, add a pointer event handler. This executes a provided function every time that the player clicks on the avocado.

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: avocado,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
	},
	function () {
		console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
	}
)
```

{{< hint info >}}
**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Once again, Visual Studio may highlight some statements in red, as the new code you added needs some more imports.

Hover over any lines in red, click the lightbulb and select `Update import from @dcl/sdk/ecs`.
{{< /hint >}}

The `pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown` statement requires defining three things:

    - What `entity` to work on.
    - An `opts` object with additional parameters, that optionally include things like what button to use and what hint text to display.
    - A function, that will be called every time the entity is interacted with

In this case, the function we're calling is simply logging the text "CLICKED AVOCADO" to the console.

In the `opts` object, we're setting the `button` field so that it listens to the pointer button (the left-mouse button on a PC). We're also adding an extra `hoverText` parameter to display a custom text in the hover hint. That way players will read the text "collect" when they hover their cursor over the avocado, and they'll know what will happen if they click on it (the avocado doesn't do much just yet, but we'll get there in the next steps).

   <!--
   TODO: how to see CONSOLE
  To read the message that is printed to the console:

   - If running the preview in VS Studio Code, open **View > Output**. The tab might already be open on the lower section of the screen.
   - If running the preview on a Chrome browser, go to **View > Developer > Javascript console**. -->

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: For an entity to be clickable, it must have a collider geometry. The model used here includes one, see the [Colliders]({{< ref "/content/creator/3d-modeling/colliders.md" >}}) section for workarounds for models that don't have a collider geometry.
{{< /hint >}}

Now let's make that click function do something more interesting, let's make the avocado vanish. Use `engine.removeEntity()` to get rid of the avocado once it's clicked. Let's add an extra line to our snippet:

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: avocado,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
	},
	function () {
		console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
		engine.removeEntity(avocado)
	}
)
```

Now when clicked, the avocado ceases to exist in the scene.

##Â Tweens

Let's start by adding a tween to our avocado, that will run as soon as the scene starts:

```ts
export function main() {
	// (...)
	// create avocado
	// pointer events

	Tween.create(myEntity, {
		mode: Tween.Mode.Scale({
			start: Vector3.One(),
			end: Vector3.create(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
		}),
		duration: 5000,
		easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_LINEAR,
	})
}
```

The provided arguments make it change scale from a scale of 1 to a scale of 0.5 a over a period of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

The `Tween` component needs the following information:

- `entity`: What entity to work on
- `start`: Starting scale.
- `end`: Ending scale.
- `duration`: Duration (in milliseconds) of start to end scaling.
- `easingFunction`: What kind of curve to use to control the rate of change over time. In this case we use linear, which results in a smooth constant change.

We can play around with the `easingFunction` parameter to get some interesting effects. For example we can use `EF_EASEINBOUNCE` to perform the transition using an ease-in bounce interpolation, which starts with a bouncy effect and then goes from slow to fast.

{{< hint info >}}
**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: You can also use the **Tween** component to move or rotate an entity over a period of time, this is a really useful tool! Learn more [here]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/move-entities.md" >}})
{{< /hint >}}

Let's get rid of this last tween we added, and instead use a tween to make the vanishing of the avocado more exciting.

To be able to reuse this, let's write a function, separate from `main()`. Don't worry, we'll be calling it from main soon.

```ts
function collect(myEntity: Entity) {
	Tween.create(myEntity, {
		mode: Tween.Mode.Scale({
			start: Vector3.One(),
			end: Vector3.Zero(),
		}),
		duration: 500,
		easingFunction: EasingFunction.EF_EASEINBOUNCE,
	})
}
```

Notice that instead of referring to our avocado entity directly, our function takes in a parameter named `myEntity`, of type `Entity. We can now call this function passing any entity we want. More on that later.

Now when we click on the avocado, instead of using `engine.removeEntity(avocado)`, let's call the `collect()` function we just defined:

```ts
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: avocado,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
	},
	function () {
		console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')

		collect(avocado)
	}
)
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: You may notice that at this point the avocado has shrunken to a size of 0, but still exists. We won't cover that in this first tutorial, but in a real scenario you should make sure you delete the entity after the tween is done, to optimize your scene's performance. See [On tween finished][here]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/3d-essentials/move-entities.md#on-tween-finished" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

##Â Reference an item from the editor

Your scene's code can also modify any items that you added visually by dragging and dropping in the editor. To fetch these items, we can use the function `engine.getEntityOrNullByName()`, and pass the name that's assigned to the item on the entity tree of the editor.

LINK

In my scene, I added this **Yellow Crate**. You can do this with any item you want, just make sure you write its name just as on the entity tree. You can otherwise rename items by just clicking on their name on the tree.

LINK

{{< hint info >}}
**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: if the code runs inside Main() or an indirectly called function, then all you added via the editor should be available
{{< /hint >}}

```ts
export function main() {
	// Avocado stuff

	const crate = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Yellow Crate')

	if (crate) {
		console.log('The crate exists')
	}
}
```

if crate explain

```ts
export function main() {
	// Avocado stuff

	const crate = engine.getEntityOrNullByName('Yellow Crate')

	if (crate) {
		console.log('The crate exists')

		pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
			{
				entity: crate,
				opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Collect' },
			},
			function () {
				console.log('CLICKED AVOCADO')
				collect(crate)
			}
		)
	}
}
```

Now the same function we defined for `collect()` is used by both items!!

##Â Interact with smart items

Question, do we cover this, or link to combine with code and say you can also do it with smart items??

Add a smart item

fetch it in the same way

get its actions, react to an action

## 3D Art Assets

A good experience will have great 3D art to go with it. If you're keen on creating those 3D models yourself, you're encouraged to, see the [3D Modeling section of our docs](/creator/3d-modeling/3d-models) for more info. But if you prefer to focus on the coding or game design side of things, you don't need to create your own assets!

Here are a few sources to get great 3D models that you can use in a Decentraland scene:

- [Asset Ovi](https://assetovi.com/)
- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
- [Archive3D](https://archive3d.net/)
- [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (3D models made primarily for 3D printing, but adaptable to Virtual Worlds)
- [ShareCG](https://www.sharecg.com/)
- [CGTrader](https://CGTrader.com)

You can also use Generative AI tools to generate your own 3D models. Check out:

- [Meshy](https://www.meshy.ai/)
- [Luma AI](https://lumalabs.ai/genie)
- [TRipo3D](https://www.tripo3d.ai/app)

{{< hint warning >}}
**ðŸ“” Note**: Models must be in the supported `.gltf` or `.glb` formats, and must have a number of triangles, textures and materials that adhere to the [scene limitations]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/optimizing/scene-limitations.md" >}}). If getting models from a third party site, pay attention to the license restrictions that the content you download has.
{{< /hint >}}

## Publish your scene

If you own LAND, a Decentraland NAME, or an ETH ENS name, or have permissions given by someone that does, you can upload your scene to Decentraland. See [publishing]({{< ref "/content/creator/sdk7/publishing/publishing.md" >}}).
