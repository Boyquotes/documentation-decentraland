Pointers are unique strings that reference an active [[entity]], usually taking the form of a [[Decentraland URN]]. Content servers can resolve these pointers to locate the referenced entity.

Remember that both [[entities]] and their [[files]] are immutable in the Decentraland content system, and their identifiers change when replacement versions are uploaded. Pointers, on the other hand, are stable references that persist across replacements.

This is achieved by automatically redirecting the pointer to a new entity when the owner uploads a replacement.

As you may gather, the most common use of pointers is obtaining the ID for the active version (i.e. latest replacement) of an entity, in order to download it.
